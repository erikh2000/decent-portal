# decent-portal

This library contains functionality that can be added to a web app that the developer intends to deploy to the [Decent Portal](https://decentapps.net).

More specifically it includes:

* The Decent Bar, a React component that displays at the top of apps hosted on the Decent Portal.
* Scripts supporting deployment of the app to staging and production targets on the Decent Portal via Github workflows.

`decent-portal` is a dependency in project code generated by the [create-decent-app tool](https://github.com/DecentAppsNet/create-decent-app) (CDA). CDA vendors (in-lines) most source code so that developers can directly edit it. But anticipating a need for updates around Decent Portal-related functionality, I created this separate library to make it easy for devs to upgrade.

`decent-portal` allows for a single web app build that can simultaneously deploy to non-Decent-Portal hosting as well as the Decent Portal. The aim is to allow you to have a single build rather than requiring multiple builds. So, for example, the Decent Bar can be configured to not render at run-time based on the domain it is hosted from.

## Design Conventions

* The library is just a library - not a framework. It should be easy to add to/remove from a project.
* Does not introduce run-time dependencies. React and ReactDOM are peer dependencies.
* CSS is defined in CSS modules with component scope. No global CSS, other than explicit imports.
* The scope of functionality is limited to things that are specific to Decent Portal.

## Using the DecentBar

If you're using the DecentBar, you probably intend for your web app to appear on the [Decent Portal](https://decentapps.net). And for that purpose, we ask that the DecentBar appears at the top of the page for your app. The idea is to have some consistency in app appearance and navigation. The elements of the Decent Bar:

* A home button, which will just show the Decent "D" logo. Clicking on it will take the user to the home page of the portal.
* The name of your app.
* Link buttons - this is a conventional place to allow the user to navigate to other pages, maybe on other websites.
* Contributors - put your name and other people's names that contributed to the project. You can omit this if you like. But consider that including your name is not just bragging -- it's reminding your users that a real person worked to make the software, and it's a gesture towards accountability.

Example:
```
<DecentBar 
  appName="Bleetbox" 
  links={[{description:"Support", url:"https://github.com/joedev/bleetbox/issues"}]} 
  contributorText="Joseph Blowsephius, Amy Hacksaw"
/>
```

### DecentBar Component Properties

* appName - This is the display name of your app.
* contributorText (optional) - List names of people who contributed to the app here.
* enabledDomains (optional) - List domain names that you want the DecentBar to render on. By default, this will include "decentapps.net", "localhost", and "127.0.0.1". The conditional rendering is useful for deploying the same web app to multiple hosting locations.
* homeUrl (optional) - Where the user will navigate when they click on the home link. By default, this will be the base URL of wherever the web app is served, e.g., an app served from "https://decentapps.net/bleetbox" will have a default home URL of "https://decentapps.net".
* links (optional) - An array of links, each of type `Link`, which is `{description:string, url:string}`. Description is what displays on the button. We recommend always including a "Support" link.
* onClickLink (optional) - The callback function you can optionally implement to customize behavior of clicking links. See "Implementing onClickLink()" section below.

### Implementing onClickLink()

If you just want to navigate to the URL provided in the link, you don't need to specify `onClickLink` or implement a handler. But you can use the handler to do things like:

* Override the default behavior for opening URLs in a separate tab or window.
* Check for unsaved user data before navigating away.
* Open modal dialogs, popup menus, or other in-app UI rather than navigating to a new URL.

The "url" attribute of the link need not be an actual URL. It can just be a code that is interpreted by your handler. So for example:

```typescript
import { DecentBar, Link, defaultOnClickLink } from 'decent-portal';

function _onClickLink(link:Link) {
  if (link.url === 'ABOUT') {
    window.prompt("I'm a very private person. But I'll share with you that I have assassinated seventy-three squirrels. It wasn't personal.");
    return;
  }
  defaultOnClickLink(link);
}

function HomeScreen() {
  const links:Link[] = [
    {support:"", url:"https://YourWebSite.com/support"},
    {description:"About Me", url:"ABOUT"}
  ];
  return (<div>
    <DecentBar appName="Squirrel Death" link={links} onClickLink={_onClickLink}/>
    <p>My stupid screen.</p>
  </div>);
}
```

When implementing your own `onClickLink()` handler, you should handle any links that need to do something besides the default behavior, and then let the rest be handled with a call to `defaultOnClickLink()`. In this way, you'll have consistent behavior with other apps on the Decent Portal. For example, there is logic in `defaultOnClickLink()` to navigate to a new tab for stay in same tab based on if the link is matching the current domain.

Whatever you do with your links and navigation, always be clear about sending the user away from the Decent Portal. Using the "Links" area of the DecentBar and opening the cross-domain link in a new tab (handled by `defaultOnClickLink()` automatically) should suffice for this.

### DecentBar Behavior on Other Hosts

By default, if you deploy your app with DecentBar on a website that isn't the Decent Portal, it won't be shown. The bar will execute minimal code to not render into the DOM. Why have this conditional hiding behavior?

* It allows you to build one web app and deploy it to multiple places. This lets you avoid setting up separate/conditional builds.
* It avoids confusing users into thinking they are on the Decent Portal when they're somewhere else that might not have the same privacy guarantees.

You can easily override the hiding behavior with the "enabledDomains" property to include a non-Decent-Portal domain. But I suspect at that point, you might be better served by making your own bar so you can customize it for the experience you want on the non-Decent-Portal domain. You're welcome to reuse the DecentBar.tsx source as a starting point (vendoring!) if that suits you.

The home icon is loaded from whatever favorite icon (favicon.ico or header-linked file) is used by your web app, which for a Decent Portal-hosted app will just be the "D" icon.
